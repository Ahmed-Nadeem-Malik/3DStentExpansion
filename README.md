# 3DStentExpansion
This is a 3D visual expansion of a stent in a vessel. I started this project to see whether I would like to apply as an intern in this technology field. This project was extremely challenging at first but was very worth it in the end as I have learnt a lot about 3D visualization in Python and even more about OOP.

If you want to run this, it's probably a good idea to run this locally. To run it, just execute the file and close out the tab each time the visualization comes up to see the next step of the expansion.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)  
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3DStentExpansion.git

2. Install the required packages
   ```bash
   pip install NumPy matplotlib

3. Run it
   ```bash
   python main.py

Please let me know if I can improvwe this code :) thanks
