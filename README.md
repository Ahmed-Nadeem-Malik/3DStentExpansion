# 3DStentExpansion
This is a 3D visual expansion of a stent in a vessel. I started this project to see whether I would like to apply in this field of technology as an intern. This project was extremely challenging at first but was very worth it in the end as I have learnt a lot about 3D visualization in Python and even more about OOP.

If you want to run this, it's probably a good idea to run this locally. To run it, just execute the file and each time the visualization comes up, close out the tab to see the next step of the expansion.
